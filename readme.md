# Project template using react and webpack

Common file structure I use when builing react apps with webpack.

## To use

After cloning this repo and installing all the dependincies with "npm install". 

run "webpack" on through the command line interface. 

This will bundle all of the react components that are linked through ./app/Main.jsx file using the "require('./components/MyComponent.jsx');"
